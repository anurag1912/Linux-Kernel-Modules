Designing arm-linux kernel modules for the class EC535 - Introduction to Embedded Systems. 

Implemented multiple kernel timers and initialized them using a user level C program. Added functionality to the timers such as 
checking the status of the timer, pausing the timer etc.

Makefile included for each kernel module and user-level program.
